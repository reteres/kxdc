地耳子洗一遍，择一遍，洗一遍，还要择一遍。那么麻烦，多么费神，吃的时候，不厌。
可以抛弃尘世芜繁，听一首音乐，洗礼自己的心灵。可以赤裸而舞，舞动灵魂的极致，畅快淋漓着内涵的唯俏唯妙。我就是音乐，音乐就是我，溶于音乐的思想和溶于思想的音乐，是个无我即空的世界，是一个脱俗的新胎儿，无罪着无知，无知着无痴，无痴着无欲。无欲着无忧。所以乐善其身，乐待其人，乐接其物。
最有兴味的是，每天从小旅社出发，去五老峰，去含鄱口，去三叠泉，去仙人洞等风景胜地观光游览。不必担心单身的孤寂，路上有的是朋友。彼此不存在尘世的纠葛，人人融进纯净的山水中，人人具涵了山水的灵性，人人都是自然人，纯洁自己，真诚她人。记得有一日，远征三叠泉归来，暮色四合，行至一山林处又被团团白云围住，找不到下山的路。“喂！——”几位在路途结识的朋友用双手合成喇叭，向山下呼喊。“喂！——”山下很快就有了回应。经山下朋友指点，我们得以从从容容蜿蜒而下。当两伙【朋友相聚后，决定合影留念；崖石上方影影绰绰有几个大字，暮霭苍茫看不清楚。待等闪光灯一闪，大家情不自禁欢呼雀跃起来。原来那第一个字是“阿”，第二个字是“弥”，第三个字是“陀”，第四个字是“佛”。

Heard today of progeny of the han made a beautiful buildings, although already is the year lead half hundred people, head also a lot of white hair, but he still didn't give up play, all the year round in the outside travel fatigue, maybe he this lifetime will never stop cause of "monk".
The ill-tempered rainy night, he walked with an umbrella for me, still clutching my hand, let me feel he's still that he continue to protect me, he spoke, "let's break up, thank you for giving me happy...
"It's so normal and accord with logic, so I" enlightenment ", love does not need a reason, because the dazed and confused, we will be dead on the ground fall in love with a follow but not worthy of love;
Break up don't need a reason, because the youth enthusiasm, we will subconsciously germination challenge another stimulus.
Because we squander his young capital, we deviate from normal orbit far in life.
